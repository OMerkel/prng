# PRNG
A PRNG (short for Pseudorandom Number Generator) is an algorithm to render number sequences looking random to users but actually being deterministic. It is intended that the PRNG gets close to idealistic random statistical behavior.

## Linear Congruential Generator
The LCG (short for Linear Congruential Generator) is based on the following number sequence.

![x_{n+1} = ( a x_{n} + c )  \mod m](res/prng_lcg_formula.png)
<!-- math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<mrow><msub>
  <mi>x</mi>
  <mn>n+1</mn>
</msub>
<mo> = </mo>
<mo>(</mo><mi>a</mi>
<msub>
  <mi>x</mi>
  <mn>n</mn>
</msub>

<mo>)</mo>
<mo>mod</mo>
<mi>m</mi>
</mrow>
</math -->
<!-- x_{n+1} = ( a x_{n} + c )  \mod m -->

whereas the modulo m defines the periodicy, x0 is called the seed of the number sequence, a being a natural number used as a multiplier and c called an increment. In case that c equals 0 (zero) the LCG is sometimes referred being a Parkâ€“Miller random number generator (after Stephen K. Park and Keith W. Miller) or a Derrick Henry Lehmer RNG.

Some basic implementations of LCGs in different programming languages are available in the public domain or other open licensing.

The statistical quality of the LCG strongly depends on choice of the parameters for multiplier a, increment c, and modulo m. Common proposals are described and available in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator and referenced publication listed in there.

Usually due to the number representation of the hardware architecture and the representation as used by the programming language a specific number range and modulo is targeted and preferred over other values for these parameters.
